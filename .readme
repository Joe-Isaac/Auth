# NodeJsAuth
Authentication with NodeJs(express), and jwt tokens

This demo project used the packages listed in the manifest in the following ways:
      Bcrypt for cryptography, that is, hashing passwords and generating salts, as well as comparing said passwords during login.
      Jwt for signing a user to generate required access tokens, as well as generating refresh tokens for when access tokens expire.
      Must store the secret keys in the environment variables.
      
This simple demo demonstrated the core concepts of modern day serverless authentication with json web tokens, which is highly efficient especially with microservices,
since authentication can be separated from the data access server.(This was not possible with the previous session based mechanism.

Also consider the role of middlewares in this and many other scenarios.
